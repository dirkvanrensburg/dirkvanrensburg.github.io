I am a software developer working at [Ecetera](www.ecetera.com.au) in Sydney, Australia. 

I have been working in the software development industry since 2000. I am passionate about all things programming and I blog not only to share experience, but also so that I can remember my ideas and solutions.

I can be contacted via email at google mail. dirk-dot-van-dot-rensburg
